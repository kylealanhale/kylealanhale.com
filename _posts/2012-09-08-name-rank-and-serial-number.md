    <p>I'm guilty. My badly-concealed smugness would seem rude.  I am disappointed when people do not catch a quote as being 'Shakespeare' and I appreciate when they do.  I seek the company and discussion of well-read people and, in so doing, avoid those who are less versed.</p>

    <p>I often ask if they have read an author like Ayn Rand in order to separate the wheat from the tares. If they respond with "Ayn Rand is an atheist, of course I didn't read it" or "Yes, but I don't agree with her philosophy" or "No, should I have?" I then know how to proceed. This is better than trying to explain a tenet of Objectivism and then discovering halfway through that I need to backtrack or skip ahead. This lesson of Ayn Rand often involves me assuming the teacher role, and I may seem overbearing to my student.</p>

    <p>Personally, I enjoy learning from those above me on this ladder, and jump at the chance to look something up I don't know. This is not the way most people feel when being told, "Oh, you haven't read it? Well let me just give you the easy version." This could be an insult as easily as be a kind offer. As the kid who always raised his hand even when that drew cold glares, and a know-it-all who stops to explain things to anyone will listen, I find it hard to contain my pride at knowing an author - especially when others do not.</p>

  content: "<p>I'm guilty, too. I've tried lately to pay more attention to being open
    about my lack of knowledge during such conversations, because when I look at the
    situation carefully, I'd rather learn new things from the people I interact with
    than from Wikipedia, even if it means confessing ignorance to those people. Learning
    together is what binds us.</p>\n"

People who like to read literature, when they talk, like to talk about who they read at least as much as what they read. The what is why we read, but the who, all of them, are woven into our conversations like trophies.

![Handwritten copy of some of this piece's text](/media/name-rank-serial-number.jpg "Who you are reading")

We could just talk about the ideas separated from the names, and the conversations would function just as as well, but we never do. The trading-card exchange of names is a territorial dance of sorts<!--more-->, or perhaps the name, rank, and serial number of the academic world. When names are given in common, they serve as pass phrases to some elite society.

When one holds a card the other does not, it establishes an ad hoc two-level hierarchy, with one ruling over the other. The ruler feels either superiority or an excitement to share something new—perhaps both in some—that accelerates their pace and increases their self-confidence. The ruled feels not just regret over not knowing the name, but a larger sort of academic guilt or incompetence, sensing that if there is this one name not on their shelf, there is likely a whole section of the repertoire that they have failed to assimilate. The ruled reacts to this incompetence with excitement to learn, feigned disinterest, or non-commital noddings, followed by a later cursory internet search and the appearance of having known all along.
