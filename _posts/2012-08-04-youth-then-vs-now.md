  content: '<p>I must confess, Kyle, that as much as I agree about the importance
    of embracing now and putting rose tinted glasses on the present et cetera and
    all that, I am an ardent champion of youth. Youth is the melody of life. Youth
    is the flax of man''s commodities. Youth is the most endangered species of them
    all. Youth is the urgency that creates culture. But, above all, Youth is exactly
    as Oscar Wilde described it: perfect — and yet, he never lost cite of that most
    important axiom: "The tragedy of old age is not that one is old, but that one
    is young." Youth creates mansions of our life''s esteems. Time''s passing dresses
    them in cobwebs, but only if we let it.</p>

    <p>And I confess that I partially had in mind your professed love for youth when I wrote this. I am certainly not preaching against the appreciation of youth; I'm just suggesting that it is an incomplete view of life. It is unripe, as I have quoted Wilde's character saying. Youth creates urgency, but doesn't our death-punctuated life create all the urgency we need?</p>

    <p>The value that youth has to offer isn't time-sensitive, and the parts of it that are time sensitive are the things that are unhealthy to obsess about after they pass. Which is really all that I'm saying: we should enjoy youth while it is our present; we ought not worry about losing it; that worry only wastes time that could be spent on whatever life is currently offering. So if you aren't worrying, then carry on with enjoying your present youth. </p>

> We degenerate into hideous puppets, haunted by the memory of the passions of which we were too much afraid, and the exquisite temptations that we had not the courage to yield to. Youth! Youth! There is absolutely nothing in the world but youth![^nothing]

![An unripe peach, still on the tree](/media/unripe-peach.jpg "Young peaches, in the orchard behind our house")

Why would religion preach against youthful indulgence? Perhaps because abstinence has given a few the impression of a quietly happy or satisfactory life—I can't begrudge them that. I also don't deny that indulgence often leads to excess and extremes, which are dangerous, if still useful.<!--more--> And the worship of or clinging to youth is really just another form of betrayal against the present. The grass is not greener ten years ago, but it could have been had I recognized then the value of the present, and can be now if I do the same.

For example, I just ate a peach, washed and sliced. The yield of the bitten peach, the sweetness of the flesh and bitter bite of the skin, the juice between fingers—they are sensations of summers past, memorial bouquets, and it is probably as much the fault of the nostalgia as it is the eating that make it my favorite fruit.

But it is, it must be, the eating that makes the fruit so great; if it weren't the nostalgia wouldn't exist, and if I don't sow seeds in present soil I'll have nothing to harvest next year when I hunger for the past. And when next year comes, and that hunger drives me to crush a peach slice against the roof of my mouth, I had better be sure to lay up in store that sensation against future winters.

So it isn't youth that we should treasure, but now. Anything that robs us of the present or of presence, that is what sin is. Sin has almost exclusively been spoken of in a religious context, as a divine rule broken. Might we instead use this law of perceived existence in time and space as its pivot? Dishonesty, idleness, addiction, vanity; being inconsiderate, marring the natural world, killing a man—these are the deadly sins.

We are able to enjoy the presence of fruits in the present better than we could those of the past. We can enjoy tomorrow's better if we savor today's. And the best peach is the one that, yesterday, was a day away from falling to the ground, and that today sits on my tongue.

> What was youth at its best? A green, an unripe time...[^unripe]
