    <p>How did Camus die?  </p>

    <p>I also find it curious that your experience, verifying the reality of Venus and its position relative to us and the sun, did not technically show Venus, as much as its silhouette.  What we saw was the absence of light, which you take as proof that the planet exists.  There is something to be said for believing the existence of a thing when it blocks out the light in your life.  </p>

    <p>Considering the idea that those select few who can observe the theories of atomic structure that exist in galaxies, etc, are therefore not so different from prophets: if I'm understanding you properly, then I'd have to disagree there. It makes them entirely different from prophets. Prophets claim knowledge and witness of things that nobody else ever gets to see, nor are they capable of seeing it, because prophetic skills (assuming they exist) don't seem to be learned; they're innate. But you could have learned to be an astronomer, or a quantum physicist; you could learn to view and interpret the same evidence that scientists do in order to create those theories. But you can never learn to be a prophet. </p>

    <p>I can't say I agree completely with Camus. Knowledge is always a self-construction project, no matter whether it's empirical or not, because knowledge is bound up in personal emotions and past experiences. When you look at a tree, your entire thought process as your brain encodes information about that tree is probably different from mine, based on previous knowledge gained about trees, how you feel about trees, and why you're even there looking at the tree in the first place. Your construction of knowledge will not be the same as mine.You're never going to find a consistent god, of any type, that you can observe like you have observed Venus, unless you want to go out on a theological limb and discuss the theory that god is in everything, including something as big as the sun or something as small as quantum foam. I have no doubt that religious inconsistency is entirely the fault of human beings, but the creation of religion is embedded so far back in human history that we're never going to be able to dig out where the inconsistency began--how could we ever hope to tell whose fault it is that we can't agree on the best set of spiritual rules to follow? I'm inclined to suggest that the inconsistency came first in thinking we need organized religion at all to validate the need for humane behavior and belief in the soul, but that's another kettle of fish. You can see venus because it is there and it can do nothing to change the fact that you can see it; but you can't ever empirically experience god because either god is not there at all, or is in a form we can't comprehend as human beings, or merely because god doesn't want to be seen.</p>

    <p>He died in a car accident; his early death is, as I said, sadly appropriate considering his ideas on how a certain and final end to life renders life itself absurd.</p>

    <p>And yes, exactly. As I outlined right after the thoughts of Camus, I still don't know for myself what those black dots are. I just know that one of them moved in relation to the others; it is through construction that I say I know the rest. The exciting thing is that our ability to personally verify our constructed knowledge is reaching levels that Camus and his philosophical bedfellows could never have guessed.</p>

    <p>It seems to me like you are making a judgement here between claims that can be: verified/experienced by many people other than you, or by few experts other than you, or by you personally. The first two, between countless thousands and a few scientists or prophets, could just be a difference in quantity. Quantity is often used a measure of verifiability. Using quantity for religion's case, you can say that millions of people do claim to have "felt the holy spirit" or had some other experience that you have not. Does the number of people observing Venus or experiencing 'the spirit' really matter? Do we just trust scientists, prophets, and experts more than any quantity of people?</p>

    <p>The last category, claims that can be verified by you personally, can be problematic. Although it seems hard to trust something that we cannot ourselves experience, yet many things we think we know we actually have not or even cannot experience for ourselves. We each trust our own eyes and judgement more than that of others by nature, but our personal experience is often just as prone to error as someone else's personal experience. We are only then, each a quantity of one. How can I say that I do/do not believe something based on my own experience, and yet say that someone else's belief, based on his/her own experience  is wrong?</p>

    <p>Great questions. You're really getting at the problem when you ask "Do we just trust scientists, prophets, and experts more than any quantity of people?" I guess my conclusion is that at some point, whether it's pure religion or pure science, or some combination of the two, we have to trust outside experiences or claims.</p>

    <p>Similarly, this isn't a question of who is right or who is wrong, it's about you. Me. Neither of us can say anything about what anyone else experiences or knows, but we can say what we have experienced, and what we know, even if with some confusion. That's the thrust of what Camus was saying.</p>

    <p>What excites me about all of this, as I've mentioned elsewhere, is the changing ecosystem of learning that allows us as individuals to verify the scientific claims of others more easily than in any other time in our known history. So it isn't that our experiences are more correct or more valuable than others, it's that we, as humanity, can corroborate each other's learning, and grow as a species. Because of this, I think that we are moving toward a universally accessible knowledge base. By the end of the century, perhaps.</p>

    <p>A critical thinking person usually is a combination of these. They work to become more of an expert themselves through their own experience, and thus their own observations become more accurate. While doing this, they also check their answers against that of others for external confirmation. As our own expert, we can also judge who to check our answers to.</p>

    <p>If I have experienced a lot of things through careful astronomic observations, for example, I will probably trust information from other sources that use that same method (other experts) more than just a quantity of people. I would check my findings with other astronomers that I know to use my methods. If they do things as I would do them, I can reasonably trust that they discover what I would have if I was there. This is nearly as good as doing the observation my self, but only if I already can trust them. </p>

    <p>I think this is why you might trust the story "I saw a dot which must be Venus, the planet" when coming from an astronomer, but not "I saw a dot which must be an alien spacecraft" when coming from a farmer. You already trust an astronomer to look at the dot the way you would, which means you must have some reason to trust astronomers based on other experiences.</p>

  content: '<p>Yes, all of that. That''s what I''m excited about. While I was listening
    to the NASA video feed, one of the researchers was talking about how "even non-scientists
    have been able to contribute to what we''re learning today" or something like
    that. I found that mildly offensive; I would say that most of the scientists in
    the history of mankind do not have science-related degrees.</p>

    <p>The prophet vs. uber-specialized research comparison wasn't about the ability to know, it was about a claim of knowledge that can't be easily corroborated by the masses. However, it still makes sense when we talk about abilities, because (at least in LDS theology), we are told that each person is capable of revelation from God, and that the prophets became such because of continual righteous living. In other words, a prophet is a specialized worshiper, just like CERN scientists are specialized researchers.</p>

    <p>Your final statement is a conclusion that I've come to as well. It isn't that God for sure doesn't exist, it's that if there is a god, that being doesn't want themselves to be known clearly to most humans for some reason. That's enough of a bummer to me that I dismiss that sort of a god.</p>

    <p>And yes, it could be argued that all knowledge is constructed, even personal experience, but that's more of a question of neuroscience, or of philosophical definitions of meaning or perception of things, than it is one of knowledge. Those both are super interesting, but weren't the aim of this treatment. I could talk about them for hours, though; the concept of meaning being filtered through our context and experience drives most of my world view.</p>

  content: '<p>If God allowed the masses to verify by physical incontrovertible evidence
    that He exists, what would that prove? It doesn''t mean they would change how
    they live or follow any of God''s moral codes, which I would assume would be his
    purpose for revealing himself.  Many witnessed Christ perform miracles, yet they
    stood by and watched or even encouraged his death.  Unless you assign it as fable,
    recorded history shows that the masses under Moses direction saw God or God''s
    direct work over and over, yet it was not enough to change behavior. You miss
    the point of knowledge and truth and it''s lasting effect the individual.  Knowledge
    in and of itself has no lasting effect on individuals.  You judge God as either
    non-existent or a God who doesn''t want to be known. There are more than 2 choices
    to consider. Very, very little of what we know is empirically derived.  Humans
    are hardwired to act on faith, religious or not.  The nature of faith is that
    it eventually leads to knowledge.  I''m glad you gained some small piece of "knowledge"
    by Venus'' transit.  Hold on to that.  </p>

    <p>The promise in the eventuality of faith doesn't outweigh the risk of wasting a life waiting for it. If there is a chance that death is the end, it makes this life so short and precious, which completely changes my priorities. It is possible to change priorities to better take advantage of that brevity and still be religious, but living by faith led me, personally, toward a lifestyle that didn't do that.</p>

    <p>People do, very successfully, change their lives because of knowledge gained, and live their lives according to what they can confirm as true. In fact, doing so in a purely empirical realm is no different than the way you live your life. You are satisfied with your confirmation of spiritual truths, enough to continue to follow the path of spiritual learning. I am satisfied by the sort of community-knowledge that I explained in the essay, enough to pursue the path of collaborative learning. However, both of our satisfactions have been attained through the same process: we believed the claims of someone else, and then had that belief confirmed in one way or another. Where we ended up is different (although I don't claim to have completely landed), but the process was the same. We started out in mostly the same place, so either your confirmations were of a nature I have never experienced, or else I just missed it or didn't value it the same way you have.</p>

    <p>And I agree; a direct manifestation of God wouldn't fulfil what you see as the goal of God in terms of developing souls according to their conscience and agency, etc. So I'm not really holding my breath for a god to step out from behind the curtain, as great as that would be. What this really is about is the knowability of God, and the apparently insurmountable disconnect between the human experience and a supreme fatherly God (any other kind is either so impotent or so petty that I can feel comfortable dismissing it). I haven't found a model of deity that bridges that disconnect, and so I cannot conceive of a god that I could know, by any means. If I can't do that, then how could I possibly take a step toward anyone's claim of deity? Furthermore, if the fatherly God I have previously hoped for does exist, then that being knows me as a child, and knows that my path is an honest one, and if I die and stand before that sort of a god, I will be overjoyed.</p>

    <p>Kyle, this is well-written. I enjoyed the mixture of the scientific with the poetic. I love, "I have fought wind and clouds and the rotation of the earth itself. I have chased the sun to the top of a barn in the orchard behind my house, scurrying up the tapering fruit ladders leaning against it with telescope and notebook under arm, and here I now sit, watching a lovely orange-cream clouded sunset."  Yes. Yes.</p>

    <p>In my lifetime, although I have had many experiences that would fall under your term of "some sort of spiritual emotion," those are not the experiences that have confirmed my religious/spiritual knowledge. I would say that they buffered, deepened, and strengthened my religious beliefs, but like you, I have mixed results with my emotions and find that I cannot always rely upon them.  These emotional/spiritual experiences--valuable and welcome though they have been in my life--merely built upon the knowledge I already had, at times encouraged me to gain knowledge that I didn't have, but most often, simply guided me or comforted me in my life. The knowledge-gaining experiences I've had were very different from these.  Although most of them happened within me, rather than out where I could see them with my eyes, I simply cannot use the term "emotion" with them because they did not come from me. They were physical, not emotional. I felt them and experienced them almost analytically and objectively. They were things that happened TO me, not FROM me. In fact, one of the things that most strikes me about these experiences is how removed I felt from them emotionally, leaving me to examine and evaluate them, to recognize and accept them. I can theorize, question, doubt, and justify away my emotional/spiritual experiences, but I cannot question or deny these knowledge-acquisition experiences anymore than I could deny that I have given birth. They are that real and tactile to me. And they were not experiences that happened because of people reasoning with me, preaching to me, bearing testimony to me, or even directly from fasting and praying, reading the scriptures, obeying the commandments, and all of those typical things. (However, I feel quite sure that if I had not been doing all of those things throughout my life, these definitive experiences would not have happened. I was prepared.) When Alma speaks of "experiment upon my words", I take him at face-value. I love it that he invites us to experiment. That appeals to me. He is not saying, "This is how it is--believe me or ELSE!" I am stubborn enough that I do not respond well to that. And I like to learn by experimentation.  But because of the experiences I've had, I feel like I have the advantage in the experiment, that I already know the end result, so I am able to discover more about the WHY, the HOW, the WHAT ELSE and the WHAT DO I DO NOW, instead of the IF. Like the old example of the bumblebee. You know the premise: If a scientist were never to have observed the bumblebee in flight, he would conclude by aerodynamic laws and aviation calculations that it would be an impossibility for the bumblebee to fly. But since he already KNOWS that the bumblebee can fly, he can concentrate on the study of "why" and "how" and "what can we use from this knowledge to expand man's capabilities in aviation?"  That is how I approach my study of religion and spirituality, as you and I have already discussed. There are SO many things that I do not know about God, about Eternity, and about my own religion,  that I am still seeking and experimenting upon, but it is from the angle that I already know that the bumblebee flies, and I'm trying to find out "why", "how", "what else", and "what do I do now?"</p>

    <p>I don't know where I would be in my quest for knowledge, were it not for those definitive experiences. Maybe I would be where you are. Not believing that the bumblebee flies.</p>

    <p>Well put. And I'm really glad you like the writing! I came from good stock.</p>

    <p>I think that what you have explained are the sort of things I was trying to describe when I asked for a god I could observe. Whether God is an anthropomorphic entity or not, most religious knowledge is gained personally, as you have described, and so it is reasonable to assume that the observation of deity would be a personal thing. I have never had that. I have experienced emotions, but nothing greater. I have seen intriguing coincidences, but not miracles. I am fascinated by the supernatural, but have no evidence of its reality and gobs of evidence against it. But I'm straying away from your point.</p>

    <p>I can't say what you have or haven't experienced, only what I have or haven't. I have experimented as the words in the book of Alma invite; I haven't observed a definitive outcome. A definitive outcome is to be expected, because if Joseph Smith translated those words, and if that translation came from God in the common language of the time in order to be best understood, then we can take the word "experiment" in that proffered translation as the same word that we use now, since its meaning has not changed in several centuries, and the scientific method has been used in one form or another since well before Joseph's time. In other words, the relationship between "experience" and "experiment" is an important one, and the act of calling it an experiment is followed by an expectation of results. Your experiments have yielded convincing experiences for you; mine have not.</p>

  content: "<p>Kyle, I perceive that these are your honest thoughts and feelings.
    As \nsuch, they have resonance and will be duly respected in what follows. I write
    this directly after concluding the essay, not yet having previewed what others
    have said.</p>\n\n<p>Critical thinking of the of the kind you've engaged is, in
    my humble opinion, far too scarce in the modern world. We live in a time when
    text books and websites offer endless explanations to some of life's most perplexing
    ordeals. Many honest inquirers read just enough to satiate a lazy curiosity. If
    what they find fits well with previously constructed \"knowledge\", the information
    is accepted and their \"knowledge\" fortified. But if a reader finds his \"knowledge\"
    alienated, information is commonly discredited and forgotten without hesitation.
    Exceptional is the man or the woman who is not quick to judge and, despite alienation,
    pauses to consider the merits of new ideas, or even old ideas rejected repeatedly
    by unwilling hearts and minds.</p>\n\n<p>At this juncture I must concede ignorance
    to the experience you so eloquently described; I was not a first-hand observer
    as Venus made her transit between Earth and Sun. So I appreciate your testament
    to the reality of her being.</p>\n\n<p>The parallel you have drawn between knowledge
    of things physical and knowledge of things spiritual is fascinating. \"Many religious
    people,\" you say, \"have seen their own black dots in front of white \ndiscs,
    and have then proclaimed knowledge of heavenly things.\" And you honestly follow
    by revealing that you \"...have never had the spiritual equivalent of what I have
    empirically witnessed today.\"</p>\n\n<p>I personally grew up in a very religious
    home and learned at a very young age the difference between \"right\" and \"wrong\".
    Initially these words were quite meaningless to me. I wasn't openly rebellious,
    but I certainly wasn't perfectly obedient either. In the course of time I eventually
    engaged in conduct that I openly knew ran counter to parental expectations. Shortly
    thereafter, I learned the conduct to be condemned by scripture. My instinctual
    reaction was to veil my wayward actions in secrecy, but little by little I began
    to palpably feel the just condemnation of an all-knowing God. My feelings of guilt
    became so overwhelming that I became preoccupied with my own filth. I distinctly
    remember instances of literally dragging one foot behind the other in a futile
    attempt to prevent my spiritual grime from bleeding onto the floor.</p>\n\n<p>As
    time went by, I kept my misdeeds in secrecy, convinced that the process of time
    would make the guilt fade away. Years passed and I found little relief. Outwardly
    I was as normal as anyone can be, earning good grades and excelling in extracurricular
    activities; inwardly I was in perpetual emotional turmoil.</p>\n\n<p>I eventually
    came to the conclusion that I must own up to my youthful mistakes and suffer the
    consequences, whatever they may be. I understood this process as repentance, as
    taught by John the Baptist and Jesus Christ in the Bible. With regret, I exposed
    my misdeeds first to my parents and then to spiritual leaders. My emotional wounds
    felt as fresh as they ever were and I expected overwhelming reprimand, but found
    only love and support. Surprisingly, the guilt didn't fade. For several weeks
    I continued attending church, feeling regretful for my misdeeds and increasing
    in resolve to be perfectly obedient to all of God's commandments. My repentance
    and intentions were sincere.</p>\n\n<p>Then, one unforgettable Sunday, the guilt
    which had once crippled my emotions was immediately and unexpectedly replaced
    by a feeling of pure joy! This experience consumed all that is reality. This was
    nothing like seeing a black dot in front of a white disc, but more like the very
    sun in full display had entered into the very bosom of my being. In truth, I believe
    it to have been the power of Jesus Christ's atonement purging my soul of all that
    was dark and gray.</p>\n\n<p>That experience is only a memory now, similar to
    your experience with Venus' transit before the sun. But I testify with all my
    heart that this experience is true and has informed my thoughts and actions in
    life from that moment to this. I hope you can appreciate my testament of the being
    of Jesus Christ. I hope you will thoughtfully consider the many thousands of witnesses
    in scripture and in the heavens that God lives and is the creator of all that
    is good, the planet Venus included. </p>\n"

    <p>Thanks for your insight, Biff. Good hearing from you. I understand your perspective, your guilt, and your experience. I don't want to in any way take that confidence from you. However, I have walked that same path, and it didn't heal me. My current path is. I can't argue with results, and with the greater confidence, peace, and wonder that I now feel about life.</p>

    <p>This path does come with a price, which balances out the benefits somewhat: anxiety that comes from a greater sense of the vastness of life, and from thoughts of how this path may affect my family and those I love. So I guess I'm feeling more of both the good and bad of life than I ever have before. That lucidity is worth much more to me than the promises of religion. I wish I could have what religion promises and keep this lucidity, but I haven't found a way to do that.</p>

As I write I am witnessing, first-hand, the transit of Venus across the sun. It isn't very often that a person can truly learn something new, and know that it is true when before it had only been believed. I now know that there exists a solid body between the Earth and the Sun.

![Photograph of notebook pages, with sketch of transit](/media/transit-of-venus-notes.jpg "Drawing the transit made me feel very 17th-century.")

Or do I? What have I really learned here? What do I know now that I didn't before? It isn't a new question. Humanity has been wondering what it means to know something since nearly as long as we have known how to write down what we know.<!--more--> An entire field of study has emerged around the topic. The opinions range widely, along a scale whose notches indicate degrees of skepticism. By even asking this question I am placing myself closer to the skeptical end of the spectrum, perhaps near our friend Camus, whose skepticism proved to be ultimately, ironically, and tragically appropriate. He had this to say on knowledge:

> Of whom and of what indeed can I say: 'I know that!' This heart within me I can feel, and I judge that it exists. This world I can touch, and I likewise judge that it exists. There ends my knowledge, and the rest is construction. [^camus]

Of what indeed, indeed. While Venus has been worshipped for several things, today I looked to her for knowledge, for something new of which I can say that thing. What I learned was this: When I looked at the sun through filtered glasses, or at a projection through a telescope, there was a black, round dot superimposed on a bright white disc, the former being approximately 100 times smaller than the latter, or somewhere in that order of magnitude. I know that other black dots were visible within the disc, much smaller. In the next hour or so when the clouds clear up I am predicting that I will verify the claims of many bright minds that the larger black dot will move with respect to the smaller ones, toward the edge of the disc. Once I witness that, it will be the conclusion of my knowledge concerning the thing. I will not know what any of the black dots are; for that matter, I will not really know what is that burning white disc in the sky.

The rest—the nature of the sun, the orbit of Venus, not to mention her composition, distance, fitness (or lack thereof) for terraformation, age, annual rainfall,[^rip] etc.—all come to me by the way of second-hand accounts. Constructions, as the translator of Camus put it. I say I know them because of the exhaustedly repeated and vetted observations of others, not to mention the many recordings in various forms that I can myself consume—but when I say that I know these things, what I'm really saying is that I trust all of them as facts: I believe in them, and I believe those who profess them.

Fundamentally, is that different from the claims of religion? In terms of repeatability and universal verifiability, sure, but on a fundamental epistemological plane, the experience is identical: one man believes the words and experiences of another. Many religious people have seen their own black dots in front of white discs, and have then proclaimed knowledge of heavenly things.

There are, though, two differences that are important to me. First, the nature of Venus has been observed and recorded by countless individuals for thousands of years. The building of knowledge from generation to generation has worked, well enough that we now capture enough data on the spots of light that were once thought to be stars that we can create visual representations of that data to show that they are actually entire galaxies. There is a flip side to that accretion of knowledge, however; it at the same time has given us wild, nearly incomprehensible theories of atomic structure,[^truthfulness] the evidence of which only the elect few can claim to be able to observe. Are they any different from prophets?

Second, and more important to me, I have never had the spiritual equivalent of what I have empirically witnessed today. The religious tell me that that is the function of some spiritual being who will confirm truths to me, generally in the form of some sort of spiritual emotion. It isn't the place for this short treatment to go into the challenges around trusting our fickle (although important) human emotions, so I will be content to say that I do not trust emotions as a compass to truth or true living. Okay, then, the religious would persist, It is a matter of faith. Some things are not meant to be known. Perhaps that is true, but consider the alternative way of living: I no longer have to merely believe the words of others when they speak of a solid planet called Venus that is between us and the sun; I now know that something is there. I still have to believe and trust that their calculations are correct that led them to say that that black dot is the same bright wanderer I see at night, but I now have even more of a reason to believe that portion. I have no such sign in religion, I only have the testimonies of others, testimonies that compete with still others', and sometimes even contradict themselves. These inconsistencies could merely be the fault of humans, granted; if so, where is the consistent god that I can observe as I have this goddess?[^conversation]

Note the visible sunspots to the left of Venus, the darkest dot." style="float: right; margin: 0 0 0 1em; width: auto;" />

In my efforts to track the movement of the small dot in relationship to the smaller dots, I have fought wind and clouds and the rotation of the earth itself. I have chased the sun to the top of a barn in the orchard behind my house, scurrying up the tapering fruit ladders leaning against it with telescope and notebook under arm, and here I now sit, watching a lovely orange-cream clouded sunset. I was able to get a few more convincing glimpses of the coy Venus, now obviously further along her transit, the darker of the sunspots visible to her left. What a glorious era it is that I, alongside millions of other lowly humans, can project her silhouette, record the image with a device that fits in my pocket, and then climb down from my perch, enter my home, and corroborate what I recorded against the video feed that NASA is supplying from atop a mountain in Hawaii. That, dear world, is knowledge, constructed or not.
